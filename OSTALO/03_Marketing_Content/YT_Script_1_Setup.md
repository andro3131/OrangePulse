## 🎬 Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

| Time | Visual Content | Audio / Voiceover |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:20** | **Intro:** Fast-paced montage of a clean TradingView chart filling with OrangePulse signals. Overlay: "OrangePulse Setup Guide". | "Welcome to OrangePulse. In the next 5 minutes, I’m going to show you how to take a raw TradingView chart and turn it into a fully automated DCA machine. Let's get started." |
| **0:20-1:00** | **Step 1: Access:** Show user navigating to Indicators → Invite-only scripts. Clicking OrangePulse (Professional). | "Once you have access, head over to Indicators and find us under 'Invite-only scripts'. One click adds the entire engine to your chart. You'll immediately see the status table and recent trade history." |
| **1:00-2:00** | **Step 2: Core Strategy:** Opening settings. Toggling between MeanReversion and TrendPullback. Changing the Base Order size. | "The engine comes with 4 built-in strategies. For today, we'll use MeanReversion. Simply define your Base Order size—either in USD or % of equity—and choose how many Safety Orders you want to deploy. We recommend starting with 10 for maximum coverage." |
| **2:00-3:00** | **Step 3: Alerts & Automation:** Show the Alert dialog in TradingView. Pasting a 3Commas or WunderTrading webhook. | "To automate, we use Alerts. OrangePulse generates precise JSON signals for BO, SO, and Exits. Just copy your Webhook URL from 3Commas or WunderTrading, paste it into the Alert box, and your bot is live 24/7." |
| **3:00-3:45** | **Step 4: Monitoring:** Zoom in on the Status Table. Pointing out "True PnL" and fee tracking. | "Monitoring is easy. The Status Table shows you everything: current exposure, next SO price, and your True PnL—which actually subtracts exchange fees so you know exactly what you're taking home." |
| **3:45-4:15** | **Outro:** Logo animation. Text: "Start Your Free Trial at orangepulse.net". | "That’s it. You’re ready to trade. Head over to orangepulse.net to grab your 14-day free trial and join our community of automated traders. Happy trading!" |
