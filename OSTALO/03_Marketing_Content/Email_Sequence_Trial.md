## Email 1: Welcome & The "Why" (Day 0)
**Subject:** 🤖 Your first trade doesn't have to be a guess.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Welcome to OrangePulse. You’ve just gained access to the same mechanical DCA logic we use to navigate the volatile BTC markets.

Most traders lose money because they trade with emotion. OrangePulse trades with physics. Our "Minotaur Accumulator" is built on the Bitcoin Power Law—the mathematical floor of the market.

**Action item for today:** Connect your exchange API (Read-only for orders!) and set up your first 1.0% test position.

Let the bot handle the noise.

## Email 2: The Math of the Dip (Day 3)
**Subject:** 📉 Why we actually like it when the price drops.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Most people panic when they see red candles. At OrangePulse, we see opportunity.

Our bot uses a 10-step Safety Order system. When the price drops, the bot automatically lowers your average entry price. You aren't "catching a falling knife"—you are accumulating at a discount.

**Look at your dashboard:** How did your average entry price move during the last dip? 

That movement is your margin of safety.

## Email 3: The "Sleep Well" Mode (Day 6 - Trial Ending)
**Subject:** 💤 2:00 AM is for sleeping, not staring at charts.

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Your trial is ending in 24 hours. By now, you’ve seen the bot execute while you were busy with your life, your work, or your sleep.

Trading isn't about hitting one "home run." It's about staying in the game, managing risk, and letting mechanical DCA do the heavy lifting over months and years.

Upgrade today to keep your bot running without interruption.
