## 🎬 Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

| Time | Visual / Screen Action | Audio / Voiceover (English) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00-0:09** | **Intro:** Logo OrangePulse (Dark/Pulse effect). Overlay: "Setup Guide Part 1: TradingView". | "Welcome to the OrangePulse setup guide. In this video, we’ll walk through the essential first step: configuring your TradingView chart for full automation." |
| **0:09-0:15** | Showing the main TradingView interface with a clean chart. | "Start by opening your main TradingView workspace. A clean chart is always best for a fresh setup." |
| **0:15-0:20** | Cursor moves to top left. Selects **1h** timeframe. | "First, ensure your timeframe is set correctly. For OrangePulse, the 1-hour timeframe is a typical standard for reliable signals." |
| **0:20-0:44** | Search for "BTCUSDT" and select the **Bybit Perpetual (Futures)** chart. | "Next, select the right chart. We’re using Bybit for this example, so make sure you choose the BTC-USDT Perpetual Futures pair to match your exchange execution." |
| **0:44-1:00** | Click Indicators → Invite-only scripts → **OrangePulse v3.0**. | "Now, head over to Indicators, look under 'Invite-only scripts', and select OrangePulse v3.0. One click will load the entire engine onto your chart." |
| **1:00-1:36** | Click the settings icon on the indicator. Zoom into the **Start Time** settings. Look at the bottom right clock. | "Open the indicator settings. Crucial step here: set your Start Time and Date slightly into the future—about 15 minutes ahead of the current time shown in your bottom right corner." |
| **1:36-1:49** | Point to the start vertical line on the chart just before the last active candle. | "You’ll see the start marker appear on the chart. This ensures the bot begins its cycle from a fresh, non-repainting state." |
| **1:49-2:09** | Navigate to the **Automation Section**. Switch to 3Commas mode. Paste IDs and Tokens. | "Back in the settings, go to the Automation tab. Choose your platform—3Commas or WunderTrading. Paste your unique Bot IDs and Email Tokens here to link the signals." |
| **2:09-2:17** | Switch to **Strategy tab**. Confirm **MeanReversion** is selected. | "Under the Strategy tab, ensure 'MeanReversion' is selected as your primary engine. It's our most battle-tested strategy for these market conditions." |
| **2:17-2:25** | Adjust Take Profit. Toggle between Fixed and Trail. | "Set your Take Profit. You can stick with a fixed target or enable the 3-stage Trailing TP to squeeze more out of the moves." |
| **2:25-2:49** | Show SO settings, Step Scale, and Volume Scale. Click OK. | "Review your DCA settings: Base Order size, Safety Orders, and Step Scale. The defaults are optimized for most users. Once happy, click OK to finalize the bot configuration." |
| **2:49-3:23** | Click the **Alerts** icon (clock). Select OrangePulse. Choose **'Alert function calls only'**. | "Time for the magic part: Alerts. Create a new alert, select OrangePulse as the condition, and very importantly: choose 'Alert function calls only' to ensure precise automation." |
| **3:23-3:26** | Type a custom Alert name (e.g., "Bybit BTC Long"). | "Give your alert a recognizable name so you can track it easily in your logs." |
| **3:26-3:46** | Switch to **Notifications tab**. Check Email. Paste the **WunderTrading Webhook**. Save. | "In the Notifications tab, enable email alerts and, most importantly, paste your official Webhook URL. Once you save, you’ll see the alert active in your sidebar." |
| **3:46-3:55** | Final look at the active chart with the alert sidebar open. | "That’s it! Your TradingView setup is complete. In the next video, we’ll configure the exchange side on WunderTrading to start live trading." |
| **3:55-4:02** | **Outro:** Logo animation + URL. | "OrangePulse: Math over emotions. Start your free trial at orangepulse.net. See you in Part 2!" |
