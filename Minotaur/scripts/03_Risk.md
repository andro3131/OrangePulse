| **[Intro]** Split screen: Calculator on left, Chart on right. | "The number one reason bots fail? Greed. Over-leveraging. Today, we do the math so you don't get liquidated." |
| **[Screen]** Minotaur Calculator. Inputting Wallet Size ($10,000). | "This is the Calculator. First, enter your Wallet Size. Let’s say $10,000. Next, Leverage. Keep it under 10x. Isolated margin only." |
| **[Screen]** Adjusting Base Order size. Showing the 'Red' warning. | "Watch this. If I make my Base Order too big ($1,000), the bottom orders turn RED. This means you run out of money before the dip ends. That’s game over." |
| **[Screen]** Finding the sweet spot (Green indicators). | "We lower the Base Order until all 10 Safety Orders are GREEN. Now we can cover a 25% or even 40% price drop." |
| **[Screen]** Comparing Aggressive vs Conservative settings. | "Aggressive means bigger wins but more risk. Conservative means you sleep like a baby. I recommend starting with a 1-2% position size max." |
| **[Outro]** Face cam. | "Trading is about survival first, profit second. Use the calculator. Don't guess. Welcome to OrangePulse." |
