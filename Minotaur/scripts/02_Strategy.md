| **[Intro]** Chart showing a massive price drop (e.g., April 2024 crash). | "Most traders panic here. They sell. They lose. But our bot? It made 19% profit during this exact crash. How? Let’s talk Strategy." |
| **[Screen]** Diagram of DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging). Base order vs Safety Orders. | "We use Mechanical DCA. We enter with a 'Base Order'. If the price drops, we don't panic. We buy more via 'Safety Orders'." |
| **[Screen]** Animation showing Average Entry price moving down. | "Each safety order lowers your Average Entry Price. The lower the price goes, the bigger we buy. We are 'Accumulating' the dip." |
| **[Screen]** Power Law Chart (Purple line bottom). | "But isn't that risky? Enter the Power Law. Bitcoin has a hard floor—the cost of mining. We know where the bottom is. We trade with physics, not feelings." |
| **[Screen]** Showing a small rally (3%) exiting the whole position. | "Here’s the magic. We don’t need a new All-Time High to win. We just need a 1.5% to 3% bounce. Even in a bear market, Bitcoin bounces. We catch that bounce, take profit, and reset." |
| **[Outro]** Face cam. | "This turns volatility from an enemy into a friend. You want the price to move. Up is good. Down is... also good. Next, let’s talk money. How much should you invest?" |
